# Node.js Test

A sort of amorphous project for me to get more comfortable using Node.js for things, and to become less awful at web development in general.

At the moment only uses Express and MySQL, but maybe more exciting technologies will appear later!?

Under MIT license, because that seems like a pretty decent choice when you're not sure what to do. (Even though it's just a test project, I'd like people to be able to copy snippets from it without breaking into a cold sweat.)
